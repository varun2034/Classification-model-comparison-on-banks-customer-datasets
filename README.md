# Classification-model-comparison-on-banks-customer-datasets

**ABSTRACT**
To compare standard Sklearn library ML classification algorithms perfomance on Dataset based on Bank customers details.

The target variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or s/he continues to be a customer.

In order to predict target variables, I will use sklearn classification algorithms:
* Logistic Regression Classification
* K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Classification
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification
* Naive Bayes Classification 
* Decision Tree Classification
* Random Forest Classification

After implementing each model, I used score and confusion matrix methods to compare models.
